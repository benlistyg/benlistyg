### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ben Listyg and I am a PhD candidate in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology Department at the University of Georgia. Currently, I work on a NSF-funded grant in the Biology Education Research Lab under the supervision of Dr. Erin Dolan. This multi-year project aims to use a variety of novel methodologies (e.g. natural language processing, experience sampling methods, mixed effects models) to examine the effect undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have on life science students' desires and interests in pursuing a career in a STEM field.
