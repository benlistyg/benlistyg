### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ben Listyg and I am third-year PhD student in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology Department at the University of Georgia under the mentorship of Dr. Nathan Carter in the Applied Psychometrics Lab. Additionally, I work as a research assistant for a NSF-funded grant in the Biology Education Research Lab under the supervision of Dr. Erin Dolan. This three-year project aims to examine the effect undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have on life science students' desires and interests in pursuing a career in a STEM field. 

My substantive research interests primarily focus around vocational interests and the vocational decisions people make in the labor market. I'm ultimately interested in improving how workers find occupations that match their interests and skillset. Methodologically, I am interested in Item Response Theory, mixed-effect models, and applied graph theory. Topics I have recently become interested in, but am not actively researching at the moment, include the ethics and perceptions of digital privacy in workplace and educational settings.

Prior to my return to academia, I was a member of the Data Team at Wyzant, an online tutor marketplace based in Chicago, IL, between March 2018 and June 2019. At Wyzant, I worked on interesting problems at the intersection of natural language processing and graph theory (with some observational causal inference problems and online field experiments thrown in the mix as well). I even co-authored a [patent](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=dVkZwewAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=dVkZwewAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC)!

I have previously worked in data or research roles for National Public Radio, Mercer Consulting, Junior Achievement of Georgia, and Invesco. I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Georgia in 2016. Additionally, I spent some time at Georgia Tech as a visiting research assistant in the summer of 2014 and was a PhD student in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology department at the University of South Florida between 2016 and 2017 before leaving to explore a career path in industry.
